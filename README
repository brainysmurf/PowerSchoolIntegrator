All-in-one python tool for integrating tools with PowerSchool for K-12 schools.

Assumptions about PowerSchool's role in K-12 school:

	* PowerSchool is the central database
	* PowerSchool is the hub of activity
	* Other tools made available need to sync with PowerSchool at some stage
	* Syncing once every day is sufficient for most cases (and so is the default)
	* If syncing once a day is not often enough, then it should be instant

Assumptions about tools that PowerSchool integrates with:

	* They will all have different means of syncing
	* They may have multiple means of syncing
	* You should be able to tell the integration tool how and when these things sync

Exemplar case:

	* PowerSchool is the school's central database
	* PowerSchool uses LDAP for authentication
	* Moodle is used for courses, uses same LDAP for authentication
	* DaviCal is used for calendering
	* Postfix email server provides students with solid email offerings
	* MediaCore is used for streaming videos	

Requirements:

	* This integrator lives on a linux box or virtualized space somewhere
	* The integrator only handles the software to actually integrate
	* You still need to set up the box (or virtual server) to talk to the tools
